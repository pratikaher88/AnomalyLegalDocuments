your use of bitbucket is subject to terms of atlassian customer agreement agreement as well as following additional terms
any capitalized terms used but not defined below have meanings in agreement

repositories
data that you upload to bitbucket are stored in repositories you designate whether repositories are public meaning that anyone coming to bitbucket website can view them private meaning that access to those repositories will be limited to those who have permission to access repositories
for each public repository that you maintain you must indicate license under which you are making contents of repository available to others as well as license under which you will accept contributions to your repository

storage rules
we do not set pre defined storage limits on your data in bitbucket
however we do enforce parameters described in bitbucket documentation to ensure that you do not use bitbucket in way that consumes disproportionate amount of system resources cpu s memory disk space bandwidth etc
that would adversely impact performance operation of bitbucket for other bitbucket users
similarly since bitbucket is designed to be used as source code repository we reserve right to remove any other content such as music video particularly if content is consuming disproportionate amount of storage
please note that since we do not maintain access to your repositories any removal of your data under section removals suspension of agreement means removal of entire repository in which offending data resides not just offending portions

accessing repositories
if you are accessing code in someone else s repository you should carefully read all licenses applicable to that repository before using contributing any code
you acknowledge that all code made available through bitbucket is responsibility of account owner controlling particular repository
atlassian is not licensor of any third party code made available through bitbucket takes no responsibility for such code

granting permissions
be careful about granting permissions to your repositories
once you grant such permissions we will not be able to prevent those users from taking actions allowed under those permissions even if you don t approve of those actions
be especially careful about granting administrative access to your repositories as some of those actions may be irreversible
for example if you grant someone permission that allows them to move content in your repository to another account we will not be able to reach into that other user s account without their permission to recover data as we are not in position to arbitrate disputes among our users
in that case your only recourse may be requesting takedown under our policy regarding reporting copyright trademark violations pursuing legal action against other user directly
