this guide describes information that github needs in order to process dmca takedown request
if you have more general questions about what dmca is how github processes dmca takedown requests please review our dmca takedown policy
due to type of content github hosts mostly software code way that content is managed with git we need complaints to be as specific as possible
these guidelines are designed to make processing of alleged infringement notices as straightforward as possible
our form of notice set forth below is consistent with form suggested by dmca statute which can be found at u s
copyright office s official website http www copyright gov
as with all legal matters it is always best to consult with professional about your specific questions situation
we strongly encourage you to do so before taking any action that might impact your rights
this guide isn t legal advice shouldn t be taken as such
tell truth
dmca requires that you swear to facts in your copyright complaint under penalty of perjury
it is federal crime to intentionally lie in sworn declaration
see u s code title section
submitting false information could also result in civil liability that is you could get sued for money damages
investigate
millions of users organizations pour their hearts souls into projects they create contribute to on github
filing dmca complaint against such project is serious legal allegation that carries real consequences for real people
because of that we ask that you conduct thorough investigation consult with attorney before submitting takedown to make sure that use isn t actually permissible
ask nicely first
great first step before sending us takedown notice is to try contacting user directly
they may have listed contact information on their public profile page in repository s readme you could get in touch by opening issue pull request on repository
this is not strictly required but it is classy
code is different from other creative content
github is built for collaboration on software code
this makes identifying valid copyright infringement more complicated than it might otherwise be for say photos music videos
for instance
this list isn t exhaustive which is why speaking to legal professional about your proposed complaint is doubly important when dealing with code
no bots
you should have trained professional evaluate facts of every takedown notice you send
if you are outsourcing your efforts to third party make sure you know how they operate make sure they are not using automated bots to submit complaints in bulk
these complaints are often invalid processing them results in needlessly taking down projects
you may receive counter notice
any user affected by your takedown notice may decide to submit counter notice
if they do we will re enable their content within days unless you notify us that you have initiated legal action seeking to restrain user from engaging in infringing activity relating to content on github
your complaint will be published
as noted in our dmca takedown policy after redacting personal information we publish all complete actionable takedown notices at https github com github dmca
include following statement i have read understand github s guide to filing dmca notice
we won t refuse to process otherwise complete complaint if you don t include this statement
but we ll know that you haven t read these guidelines may ask you to go back do so
identify copyrighted work you believe has been infringed
this information is important because it helps affected user evaluate your claim give them ability to compare your work to theirs
specificity of your identification will depend on nature of work you believe has been infringed
if you have published your work you might be able to just link back to web page where it lives
if it is proprietary not published you might describe it explain that it is proprietary
if you have registered it with copyright office you should include registration number
if you are alleging that hosted content is direct literal copy of your work you can also just explain that fact
identify material that you allege is infringing copyrighted work listed in item above
it is important to be as specific as possible in your identification
this identification needs to be reasonably sufficient to permit github to locate material
at minimum this means that you should include url to material allegedly infringing your copyright
if you allege that less than whole repository infringes identify specific file s line numbers within file that you allege infringe
if you allege that all of content at url infringes please be explicit about that as well
finally please note that github will not automatically disable forks when disabling parent repository
if you have investigated analyzed forks of repository believe that they are also infringing please explicitly identify each allegedly infringing fork
please also confirm that you have investigated each individual case that your sworn statements apply to each identified fork
explain what affected user would need to do in order to remedy infringement
again specificity is important
when we pass your complaint along to user this will tell them what they need to do in order to avoid having rest of their content disabled
does user just need to add statement of attribution
do they need to delete certain lines within their code entire files
of course we understand that in some cases all of user s content may be alleged to infringe there s nothing they could do short of deleting it all
if that s case please make that clear as well
provide your contact information
include your email address name telephone number physical address
provide contact information if you know it for alleged infringer
usually this will be satisfied by providing github username associated with allegedly infringing content
but there may be cases where you have additional knowledge about alleged infringer
if so please share that information with us
include following statement i have good faith belief that use of copyrighted materials described above on infringing web pages is not authorized by copyright owner its agent law
also include following statement i swear under penalty of perjury that information in this notification is accurate that i am copyright owner am authorized to act on behalf of owner of exclusive right that is allegedly infringed
include your physical electronic signature
fastest way to get response is to send email notification to copyright github com
you may include attachment if you like but please also include plain text version of your letter in body of your message
if you must send your notice by physical mail you can do that too but it will take substantially longer for us to receive respond to it
notices we receive via plain text email have much faster turnaround than pdf attachments physical mail
if you still wish to mail us your notice our physical address is
