ve posted github re rights holder looking issue notice page will hopefully help demystify law bit well policies complying just want submit notice can skip end legal matters always best consult professional specific questions situation strongly encourage taking action might impact rights guide isn t legal advice shouldn t taken order understand dmca policy lines draws s perhaps helpful consider life enacted dmca internet based service provider like github liable copyright infringement united states just hosting users pictures music videos code true even actual knowledge infringing content problem since even single claim copyright infringement can carry statutory damages potential damages high multiplied across millions users cloud computing user generated content sites like youtube facebook github probably never existed least without passing cost downstream users dmca attempted fix problem creating called copyright liability safe harbor internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user generated content see u s code title section essentially long service provider follows dmca s notice takedown rules won t liable copyright infringement based user generated content important github maintain dmca safe harbor status dmca provides two simple straightforward procedures github users know takedown notice procedure copyright holders request content removed ii counter notice procedure users get content reenabled content taken mistake dmca takedown notices used copyright owners ask github take infringing content software designer developer create copyrighted content every day someone else using copyrighted content unauthorized manner github can send us dmca takedown notice request infringing content changed removed hand counter notices can used correct mistakes maybe person sending takedown notice hold copyright realize license made mistake takedown notice since github usually know mistake dmca counter notice allows let us know ask put content back dmca framework bit like passing notes class copyright owner hands github complaint user s written correctly pass complaint along user user disputes complaint can pass note back saying github exercises little discretion process determining whether notices meet minimum requirements dmca parties lawyers evaluate merit claims bearing mind notices must made penalty perjury basic steps process copyright owner investigates copyright owner always conduct initial investigation confirm copyright original work b content github unauthorized infringing example employee acme web company finds company s code github repository acme web company licenses source code several trusted partners sending take notice acme review licenses agreements confirm code github authorized copyright owner sends notice conducting investigation copyright owner prepares sends takedown notice github assuming takedown notice sufficiently detailed according statutory requirements explained guide will post notice public repository pass link along affected user github asks user make changes notice alleges entire contents repository infringe will skip step disable entire repository expeditiously otherwise github disable access specific files within repository will contact user created repository give approximately hours delete modify content specified notice ll notify copyright owner give user chance make changes user notifies github changes user chooses make specified changes must tell us within approximately hour window don t will disable repository described step user notifies us made changes will verify changes made notify copyright owner copyright owner revises retracts notice user makes changes copyright owner must review renew revise takedown notice changes insufficient github will take action unless copyright owner contacts us either renew original takedown notice submit revised one copyright owner satisfied changes may either submit formal retraction else nothing github will interpret silence longer two weeks implied retraction takedown notice github may disable access content github will disable user s content copyright owner alleged copyright user s entire repository noted step ii user made changes given opportunity noted step iii copyright owner renewed takedown notice user chance make changes copyright owner chooses instead revise notice will go back step repeat process revised notice new notice user may send counter notice encourage users content disabled consult lawyer options user believes content disabled result mistake misidentification may send us counter notice original notice will make sure counter notice sufficiently detailed explained guide will post public repository pass notice back copyright owner sending link copyright owner may file legal action copyright owner wishes keep content disabled receiving counter notice will need initiate legal action seeking court order restrain user engaging infringing activity relating content github words might get sued copyright owner notify github within days initiated legal action github will reenable disabled content one best features git ability users fork one another s repositories mean essence means users can make copy project make changes copy either push back main project just keep variation project call copies fork original repository turn may also called parent fork github will automatically disable forks disabling parent repository forks belong different users may altered significant ways may licensed used different way protected fair use doctrine github conduct independent investigation forks expect copyright owners conduct investigation believe forks also infringing expressly include forks takedown notice recognize many valid reasons may able make changes within approximate hour window provide repository gets disabled maybe message got flagged spam maybe vacation maybe don t check email account regularly maybe just busy get respond let us know liked make changes somehow missed first opportunity will re enable repository one additional time approximately hours allow make changes must notify us made changes order keep repository enabled hour window noted step please note will provide one additional chance believe transparency virtue public know content removed github informed public can notice surface potential issues otherwise go unnoticed opaque system post redacted copies legal notices receive including original notices counter notices retractions https github com github dmca will publicly publish personal contact information will remove personal information except usernames urls publishing notices will however redact information notice unless specifically ask us examples published notice counter notice see look like remove

around internet hard find commentary criticism copyright system general dmca particular github acknowledges appreciates important role dmca played promoting innovation online believe copyright laws

ve posted github re rights holder looking issue notice page will hopefully help demystify law bit well policies complying just want submit notice can skip end legal matters always best consult professional specific questions situation strongly encourage taking action might impact rights guide isn t legal advice shouldn t taken order understand dmca policy lines draws s perhaps helpful consider life enacted dmca internet based service provider like github liable copyright infringement united states just hosting users pictures music videos code true even actual knowledge infringing content problem since even single claim copyright infringement can carry statutory damages potential damages high multiplied across millions users cloud computing user generated content sites like youtube facebook github probably never existed least without passing cost downstream users dmca attempted fix problem creating called copyright liability safe harbor internet service providers hosting allegedly infringing user generated content see u s code title section essentially long service provider follows dmca s notice takedown rules won t liable copyright infringement based user generated content important github maintain dmca safe harbor status dmca provides two simple straightforward procedures github users know takedown notice procedure copyright holders request content removed ii counter notice procedure users get content reenabled content taken mistake dmca takedown notices used copyright owners ask github take infringing content software designer developer create copyrighted content every day someone else using copyrighted content unauthorized manner github can send us dmca takedown notice request infringing content changed removed hand counter notices can used correct mistakes maybe person sending takedown notice hold copyright realize license made mistake takedown notice since github usually know mistake dmca counter notice allows let us know ask put content back dmca framework bit like passing notes class copyright owner hands github complaint user s written correctly pass complaint along user user disputes complaint can pass note back saying github exercises little discretion process determining whether notices meet minimum requirements dmca parties lawyers evaluate merit claims bearing mind notices must made penalty perjury basic steps process copyright owner investigates copyright owner always conduct initial investigation confirm copyright original work b content github unauthorized infringing example employee acme web company finds company s code github repository acme web company licenses source code several trusted partners sending take notice acme review licenses agreements confirm code github authorized copyright owner sends notice conducting investigation copyright owner prepares sends takedown notice github assuming takedown notice sufficiently detailed according statutory requirements explained guide will post notice public repository pass link along affected user github asks user make changes notice alleges entire contents repository infringe will skip step disable entire repository expeditiously otherwise github disable access specific files within repository will contact user created repository give approximately hours delete modify content specified notice ll notify copyright owner give user chance make changes user notifies github changes user chooses make specified changes must tell us within approximately hour window don t will disable repository described step user notifies us made changes will verify changes made notify copyright owner copyright owner revises retracts notice user makes changes copyright owner must review renew revise takedown notice changes insufficient github will take action unless copyright owner contacts us either renew original takedown notice submit revised one copyright owner satisfied changes may either submit formal retraction else nothing github will interpret silence longer two weeks implied retraction takedown notice github may disable access content github will disable user s content copyright owner alleged copyright user s entire repository noted step ii user made changes given opportunity noted step iii copyright owner renewed takedown notice user chance make changes copyright owner chooses instead revise notice will go back step repeat process revised notice new notice user may send counter notice encourage users content disabled consult lawyer options user believes content disabled result mistake misidentification may send us counter notice original notice will make sure counter notice sufficiently detailed explained guide will post public repository pass notice back copyright owner sending link copyright owner may file legal action copyright owner wishes keep content disabled receiving counter notice will need initiate legal action seeking court order restrain user engaging infringing activity relating content github words might get sued copyright owner notify github within days initiated legal action github will reenable disabled content one best features git ability users fork one another s repositories mean essence means users can make copy project make changes copy either push back main project just keep variation project call copies fork original repository turn may also called parent fork github will automatically disable forks disabling parent repository forks belong different users may altered significant ways may licensed used different way protected fair use doctrine github conduct independent investigation forks expect copyright owners conduct investigation believe forks also infringing expressly include forks takedown notice recognize many valid reasons may able make changes within approximate hour window provide repository gets disabled maybe message got flagged spam maybe vacation maybe don t check email account regularly maybe just busy get respond let us know liked make changes somehow missed first opportunity will re enable repository one additional time approximately hours allow make changes must notify us made changes order keep repository enabled hour window noted step please note will provide one additional chance believe transparency virtue public know content removed github informed public can notice surface potential issues otherwise go unnoticed opaque system post redacted copies legal notices receive including original notices counter notices retractions https github com github dmca will publicly publish personal contact information will remove personal information except usernames urls publishing notices will however redact information notice unless specifically ask us examples published notice counter notice see look like remove content will post link related notice place please also note although will publicly publish unredacted notices may provide complete unredacted copy notices receive directly party whose rights affected policy github appropriate circumstances sole discretion disable terminate accounts users may infringe upon copyrights intellectual property rights github others ready submit notice counter notice poke around internet hard find commentary criticism copyright system general dmca particular github acknowledges appreciates important role dmca played promoting innovation online believe copyright laws
